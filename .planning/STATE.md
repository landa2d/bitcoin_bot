# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-05-26)

**Core value:** Synthesis with editorial integrity — autonomous ingestion accelerates output, but every consequential publication is gated by human approval. Silence and homogenization are the failure modes to design against.
**Current focus:** Phase 03 — design-tokens

## Current Position

Phase: 4
Plan: Not started
Status: Executing Phase 03

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: Phase 1 is diagnostic-only (no code changes) — the existing `aiagentspulse.com` publish path is unknown and must be confirmed before renderer design
- Roadmap: Negotiation ships as a section inside payments-settlement, not its own block (80% future-tense today)
- Roadmap: Global synthesis defaults N=5/T=30; no per-block tuning in v1
- Roadmap: All synthesis LLM calls route through `llm-proxy:8200` — direct Anthropic SDK is the RivalScope anti-pattern
- Roadmap: `economy_map` access via direct PostgREST with `Accept-Profile: economy_map` header — sidesteps supabase-py `.in_()` silent failure

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 1 must confirm the publish path before Phase 4 (renderer) can be planned in detail; until then, Phase 4 success criterion 5 ("reuse existing publish path") carries a contingency on Phase 1 findings recommending a sibling route instead.
