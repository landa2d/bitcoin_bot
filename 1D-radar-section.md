# 1D — Radar Section for Newsletter Agent

## Phase
Phase 1 — Foundation

## Parallel/Sequential
**PARALLEL** — Can run simultaneously with 1A, 1B, 1C

## Dependencies
None — uses existing topic lifecycle data

## Prompt

Add a "Radar" section to the AgentPulse Newsletter Agent. This section surfaces 3-4 topics currently in the "emerging" phase from the topic lifecycle tracker, giving readers a preview of what might become a future Spotlight.

### Purpose
Radar creates a narrative arc across issues. A topic shows up on Radar → weeks later it becomes the Spotlight → it fades back into Signals as it matures. Returning readers start to feel like they're tracking the evolution of the space.

### Requirements

1. **Query**: Pull topics from the existing topic lifecycle tracker where `lifecycle_phase = 'emerging'`, ordered by velocity (highest first), limited to 4
2. **Exclusions**: Skip topics that are already covered in Signals for this issue (no duplication)
3. **Format**: Each Radar item is exactly:
   - **Topic name** — One sentence explaining why it's worth watching
   - That's it. No analysis, no links, no bullet sub-points. This is a teaser.
4. **Generation**: The Newsletter Agent should generate the "why it's worth watching" sentence. It should hint at the tension or potential significance without going deep. Examples:
   - **Agent-to-agent payments** — Early experiments in autonomous agent commerce are surfacing hard questions about liability and reversibility that nobody has good answers for yet.
   - **Local model fine-tuning for agents** — A wave of open-source tools is making it possible to fine-tune small models for specific agent tasks, which could break the API dependency that defines most agent architectures today.
5. **Placement**: Radar goes after Signals, before Scorecard (when present)
6. **Fallback**: If fewer than 3 topics are in emerging phase, include topics in early "debating" phase to fill the section. If still not enough, skip the section for that issue entirely — don't force it.

### Template Changes
Update the Newsletter Agent's template to include:

```
## On Our Radar

[3-4 items, each one line: bold topic name + one sentence]
```

### Implementation Notes
- This is a lightweight addition — it's just a query + short generation, no deep research needed
- The one-sentence descriptions should be generated by the Newsletter Agent, not pre-stored
- Keep the sentences punchy — if they read like abstracts, they're too long

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Radar section appears in newsletter output
- [ ] Pulls from emerging lifecycle topics correctly
- [ ] No duplication with Signals section
- [ ] Each item is one topic name + one sentence (no more)
- [ ] Fallback behavior works when fewer than 3 emerging topics exist
- [ ] Placement is correct: after Signals, before Scorecard
